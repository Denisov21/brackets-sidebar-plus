[Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) is an open-source code editor built with the web for the web.

You can hide your sidebar using **View->Hide Sidebar** Or **Ctrl+Shift+H**. But it is little hard, if you want to access it immediatley. This extension will help you to access sidebar when you HOVER at the left end.

You can see this [youtube](http://youtu.be/NpVFG7rqXXM) video for demo.

Known Issues:

1.Right-click has an issue while sidebar is in Auto/Show hide mode.

2.a.Choose View->Hide Side Bar,  b.Select a file under Working Files,  c.Do auto hide/show,  
d.Then again choose View->Show Side Bar.  In this case you will not see rectangle pointer. 
You have to again click on that file to see it.
  
I will try to improve this extension in future if it will get more users.
